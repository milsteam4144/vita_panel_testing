# VITA Panel Demo Prep Meeting
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Time:** 4:50 PM  
**Attendees:** Agent Scully (Senior Dev), Priya Sharma (UI/UX), Alex Rodriguez (QA), Jamie Kim (Intern), Teacherbot (Domain Expert)  
**Objective:** Assess current state and plan for 48-hour demo deadline

## Current Status Assessment

### What's Working âœ…
- **LM Studio Integration**: Successfully connected to local model (dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b)
- **Core UI**: File upload, syntax highlighting, chat interface functional
- **Multi-Agent Communication**: Initial debugging interaction works
- **Dependencies**: Updated to 2025 versions, proper venv setup
- **Basic Workflow**: Upload Python file â†’ Debug button â†’ AI analysis

### Critical Issues ðŸš¨

#### Marcus Chen (Senior Dev - *Pragmatic Problem-Solver*):
> "The AutoGen agents are getting stuck in a loop sending empty messages after the first interaction. This is a showstopper. We need to either fix the agent orchestration or consider AutoGen Studio as an alternative. The core issue seems to be in the `delayed_initiate_chat` or agent reply handling."

#### Priya Sharma (UI/UX - *User Experience Perfectionist*):
> "From a demo perspective, the UI looks decent but the chat interface becomes confusing when agents start spamming empty messages. Users won't understand what's happening. We need either: 1) Fix the agent behavior, or 2) Add better UI feedback for agent states."

#### Alex Rodriguez (QA - *Risk-Aware Detail Hunter*):
> "We have several issues that could embarrass us during demo:
> - Syntax warning in test.py:91 (`is not` with literal)
> - Model name mismatch (code says 'lm-studio' but actual model is 'dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b')
> - No error handling for when LM Studio is offline
> - Agent loop could hang the demo indefinitely"

#### Jamie Kim (Intern - *Enthusiastic Tech Explorer*):
> "I've been reading about AutoGen Studio - it's like a low-code interface for building multi-agent workflows. Maybe we should consider it? Also, the logs show the agents are working but sending empty content. Could be a prompt engineering issue or rate limiting?"

#### Teacherbot (Domain Expert - *Systems Architecture Specialist*):
> "After reviewing the logs, I believe I've identified the root cause. AutoGen is trying to use agent names (`Debugger`, `Corrector`, `Student`) as distinct model identities, but LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible API only recognizes standard roles like `user` and `assistant`. The agents should all identify with the same model name while using their distinct system prompts for behavior differentiation. This explains the empty message loop - the API calls are failing silently due to invalid role mapping."

## AutoGen Studio Discussion

### Marcus's Technical Analysis:
- **AutoGen Studio Pros**: Visual workflow builder, better agent orchestration, built-in UI
- **AutoGen Studio Cons**: Would require rewriting our Panel UI integration, learning curve
- **Current Code Issues**: Agent reply chain getting corrupted, possibly due to async handling

### Priya's UX Perspective:
- Current interface has good bones but poor error states
- AutoGen Studio might give us a more polished agent experience
- Risk: Starting over with 48 hours left is dangerous

## 48-Hour Demo Strategy Options

### Option A: Fix Current Implementation (Marcus's Recommendation)
**Timeline: 8-12 hours**
- Debug the agent empty message loop (priority 1)
- Fix syntax warnings and model name mismatch (priority 2)
- Add error handling for offline LM Studio (priority 3)
- Test with multiple file uploads (priority 4)

### Option B: Hybrid Approach (Priya's Suggestion)
**Timeline: 16-20 hours**
- Keep current Panel UI for file upload/display
- Replace AutoGen orchestration with AutoGen Studio backend
- Create API bridge between Panel frontend and AutoGen Studio

### Option C: Full AutoGen Studio Migration (Jamie's Wild Card)
**Timeline: 24-36 hours**
- Complete rewrite using AutoGen Studio
- Risk: Might not finish in time
- Reward: More robust, production-ready solution

## Immediate Action Plan (Next 4 Hours)

### Marcus (Senior Dev):
1. ~~Debug the agent empty message issue (2 hours)~~ **COMPLETED with Teacherbot's diagnosis**
2. ~~Fix syntax warnings and model name config (30 mins)~~ **COMPLETED** 
3. Add basic error handling (1 hour)
4. Test with Jamie's help (30 mins)

### Teacherbot (Domain Expert):
1. ~~Diagnose agent role mapping issue~~ **COMPLETED** - Fixed model name and role handling
2. Update `.env.example` with correct model name (15 mins)
3. Test fix with team (30 mins)

### Priya (UI/UX):
1. Design error states for offline LM Studio (1 hour)
2. Improve agent status indicators (1 hour)
3. Create demo script and user flow (2 hours)

### Alex (QA):
1. Write test scenarios for demo (1 hour)
2. Test all edge cases (LM Studio offline, bad files, etc.) (2 hours)
3. Create fallback demo plan (1 hour)

### Jamie (Intern):
1. Research AutoGen Studio integration options (2 hours)
2. Set up AutoGen Studio environment for Option B backup (2 hours)

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**: Agent loop issue could make demo unusable  
**MEDIUM RISK**: LM Studio dependency (what if it crashes during demo?)  
**LOW RISK**: Minor syntax issues, cosmetic problems  

## Decision Point Tomorrow Morning (9 AM):
If Marcus can't fix the agent loop by 9 AM June 19, we pivot to Option B (Hybrid approach) or prepare a simplified single-agent demo.

## Demo Fallback Plan:
- Single agent instead of multi-agent (debugger only)
- Pre-recorded demo video if live demo fails
- Slide deck explaining technical architecture
