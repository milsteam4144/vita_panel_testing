## Safe Practice Overview
**Skill to Practice:** 
**Risk Level:** [No Risk - Sandbox Environment]
**Attempts Allowed:** Unlimited
**Learning Focus:** Making mistakes safely and learning from them

## Safety Guarantees
‚úÖ **This is a sandbox** - Nothing you do here affects production
‚úÖ **Mistakes are encouraged** - Learn by experimenting
‚úÖ **Reset available** - Can start fresh anytime
‚úÖ **No grades** - Focus on learning, not performance

## FLOW Practice Pattern

### 1. EXPLORE (Learn)
**Try these experiments:**
- [ ] Experiment 1: 
- [ ] Experiment 2: 
- [ ] Experiment 3: 

**What happens when you:**
- Change X to Y?
- Remove component Z?
- Add feature A?

### 2. BREAK (Understand)
**Intentionally cause errors:**
- [ ] Error type 1: How to trigger it
- [ ] Error type 2: How to trigger it
- [ ] Error type 3: How to trigger it

**Document what you observe:**
```markdown
When I did: [action]
This happened: [result]
Because: [explanation]
```

### 3. FIX (Plan)
**For each error, plan a fix:**
1. Error: 
   - Root cause: 
   - Fix approach: 

2. Error: 
   - Root cause: 
   - Fix approach: 

### 4. REBUILD (Execute)
**Implement fixes:**
```python
# Original broken code
# ...

# Fixed version with explanation
# ...
```

### 5. TEST (Verify)
**Confirm your understanding:**
- [ ] Can recreate the error on demand
- [ ] Can fix it reliably
- [ ] Understand why the fix works
- [ ] Can prevent it in future code

### 6. SHARE (Document)
**Teaching moment:**
Write a short guide for another student who might encounter this issue:

```markdown
## How to Handle [Error Type]

**You'll see this when:**

**It happens because:**

**To fix it:**

**To prevent it:**
```

## Sandbox Resources
- **Reset Command:** `git checkout -b fresh-start`
- **Sample Data:** Located in `/sandbox/data/`
- **Test Environment:** `http://localhost:3000/sandbox`
- **Debug Tools:** [List available tools]

## Common Experiments to Try
1. **What if I...** delete this important-looking file?
2. **What if I...** put invalid data in this field?
3. **What if I...** call this function with wrong parameters?
4. **What if I...** create an infinite loop?
5. **What if I...** mix up the order of operations?

## Learning from Mistakes
After each experiment, record:
- **Hypothesis:** I think X will happen
- **Result:** Actually, Y happened
- **Learning:** This teaches me that...

## No Judgment Zone
Remember:
- üéØ Goal is understanding, not perfection
- üîÑ Repetition builds confidence
- üí° "Stupid questions" often lead to insights
- ü§ù Share your mistakes to help others learn

## When You're Done
- [ ] Documented at least 5 experiments
- [ ] Successfully broke and fixed 3 things
- [ ] Can explain one concept you didn't understand before
- [ ] Feel more confident experimenting with code
- [ ] Ready to help someone else learn this
