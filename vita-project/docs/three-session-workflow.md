# The Three-Session Educational Workflow

## Overview
Based on FLOW (Following Logical Work Order) and SAFE (Scaled Agile Framework for Education) principles, we structure learning activities into three distinct sessions to protect deep work and maximize learning effectiveness.

> "You can either plan your work... or your work will plan you."

## The Three Sessions That Transform Learning

### Session 1: Discovery & Planning 🔍
**Purpose**: Pure strategic thinking without implementation pressure
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Environment**: Collaborative, discussion-friendly

#### FLOW Steps:
1. **LEARN**: Understand the problem completely
   - Read requirements thoroughly
   - Research relevant concepts
   - Gather all necessary resources
   - Ask clarifying questions

2. **UNDERSTAND**: Process and internalize
   - Break down complex problems
   - Identify what you know vs. don't know
   - Map out dependencies
   - Recognize patterns from previous work

#### Key Activities:
- [ ] Create or claim GitHub issue
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria clearly
- [ ] Research unfamiliar concepts
- [ ] Identify potential challenges
- [ ] Estimate complexity and effort
- [ ] Plan learning objectives

#### Exit Criteria:
- Clear understanding of what needs to be built
- Confidence in approach direction
- Questions identified for Session 2
- Ready to move to design phase

### Session 2: Design & Review 📐
**Purpose**: Create implementation plan and get feedback
**Duration**: 45-90 minutes  
**Environment**: Collaborative, feedback-oriented

#### FLOW Steps:
3. **PLAN**: Design the solution approach
   - Create step-by-step implementation plan
   - Design data structures/algorithms
   - Plan testing strategy
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

#### Key Activities:
- [ ] Create feature branch with clear naming
- [ ] Open draft Pull Request immediately
- [ ] Write implementation plan in PR description
- [ ] Create pseudo-code or detailed comments
- [ ] Design test cases
- [ ] Request early feedback on approach
- [ ] Refine plan based on input

#### Exit Criteria:
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Stakeholder/mentor approval of approach
- Test strategy defined
- Ready for focused implementation
- PR template filled out completely

---

### Session 3: Deep Work Implementation ⚡
**Purpose**: Execute the plan with protected focus time
**Duration**: 2-4 hours (or multiple shorter focused blocks)
**Environment**: **PROTECTED** - minimal interruptions

#### FLOW Steps:
4. **EXECUTE**: Implement following the plan
   - Code according to pre-defined plan
   - Implement tests as you go
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Stay focused on execution only

5. **VERIFY**: Test and validate
   - Run all tests (unit, integration, manual)
   - Check against acceptance criteria
   - Perform edge case testing
   - Validate with real data/scenarios

6. **DOCUMENT**: Capture knowledge and prepare for review
   - Update documentation
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Prepare PR for review
   - Reflect on learning outcomes

#### Key Activities:
- [ ] Set "Do Not Disturb" mode (Red Light status)
- [ ] Follow implementation plan step-by-step
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD when appropriate)
- [ ] Commit working code incrementally
- [ ] Update PR with progress
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Mark PR ready for review
- [ ] Write reflection on learning

#### Exit Criteria:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Tests passing
- Code reviewed and approved
- Documentation updated
- Learning objectives achieved

## Student Protection Protocol

### "Do Not Pet the Students While They're Learning"

Based on research showing context switching costs 15-20 minutes of focus recovery:

#### Session 1 & 2: Green/Yellow Light 🟢🟡
- **Available** for collaboration and questions
- **Encourage** discussion and feedback
- **Welcome** interruptions for learning

#### Session 3: Red Light 🔴
- **Protected** deep work time
- **Emergency only** interruptions
- **Respect** the learning zone

### FOCUS System for Students

**F** - Flow Occurs when  
**O** - Concentration  
**C** - Undisturbed  
**U** - Succeeds  
**S** - Systematically  

#### Status Indicators:
- 🟢 **Green**: Available for collaboration, questions, help
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Working but can be interrupted for important matters
- 🔴 **Red**: Deep work in progress - urgent matters only

Students can indicate status in:
- GitHub profile status
- Slack/Discord status
- Physical signals (headphones, desk signs)
- Calendar blocks

## The Assembly Line for Learning

Think of our workflow like a well-designed educational assembly line:

| Stage | Purpose | Quality Gate | Outcome |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Issues** | Work orders | Clear requirements | Focused learning objective |
| **Planning** | Design blueprint | Mentor approval | Executable plan |
| **Implementation** | Production | Automated tests | Working solution |
| **Review** | Quality control | Peer feedback | Knowledge validation |
| **Merge** | Delivery | Final approval | Mastery achieved |

Each step makes the next one easier and more effective.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Students:

```markdown
## My Three-Session Checklist

### Before Session 1:
- [ ] Choose appropriate time when I can focus
- [ ] Gather all materials and resources
- [ ] Set realistic expectations for the session

### Before Session 2:
- [ ] Review Session 1 outputs
- [ ] Prepare specific questions
- [ ] Schedule time for collaboration

### Before Session 3:
- [ ] Clear calendar for deep work block
- [ ] Set "Do Not Disturb" status
- [ ] Have plan readily available
- [ ] Prepare environment (coffee, music, etc.)

### After each session:
- [ ] Reflect on what worked well
- [ ] Note what could be improved
- [ ] Plan next session timing
```

### For Mentors/Instructors:

```markdown
## Supporting the Three-Session Flow

### Session 1 Support:
- Be available for questions
- Help clarify requirements
- Guide research direction
- Encourage thorough planning

### Session 2 Support:
- Review implementation plans
- Provide architectural guidance
- Challenge assumptions constructively
- Approve approach before implementation

### Session 3 Support:

- Be available for urgent issues only
- Celebrate completion
- Provide encouragement
```

## Benefits You'll Experience

- **Deeper Learning**: Protected time allows for flow state
- **Increased Confidence**: Systematic approach builds competence

### For Instructors:
- **Predictable Progress**: Three-phase structure enables better tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review points catch issues early
- **Scalable Support**: Clear phases allow targeted assistance
- **Improved Outcomes**: Students develop professional habits

## Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### ✅ Effective Patterns:
- **Session Separation**: Complete one before starting next
- **Plan First**: Always design before implementing
- **Protected Time**: Honor deep work boundaries
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, frequent commits

### ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- **Skip to Code**: Jumping straight to implementation
- **Session Bleeding**: Mixing planning with implementation
- **Constant Interruption**: Breaking deep work flow
- **Perfect Planning**: Over-planning without starting

## Adapting to Different Learning Styles

### For Visual Learners:
- Use diagrams and flowcharts in Session 2
- Create visual progress indicators
- Mind mapping for Session 1 exploration

### For Kinesthetic Learners:
- Hands-on exploration in Session 1
- Prototype early in Session 2
- Break Session 3 into smaller action blocks

### For Auditory Learners:
- Discuss plans out loud in Session 2
- Use rubber duck debugging in Session 3
- Pair programming for Session 3

## Remember

> "When you follow structure, you discover that the freedom you want was always there... waiting for you to create the conditions that allow it to emerge."

### Key Insights:
1. **Planning enables flow** - good preparation makes implementation effortless
2. **Protection creates productivity** - defending focus time multiplies output
3. **Structure liberates creativity** - clear frameworks free mental energy for innovation
4. **Process prevents pressure** - systematic approaches reduce stress and improve outcomes

**Try the three-session approach on your next learning task. Notice how natural it feels.**
